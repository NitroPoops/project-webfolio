            <p>
                In the world of coding, there's a term that's feared,<br />
                A tangled mess of code that's always weird,<br />
                It's called spaghetti code, a developer's bane,<br />
                A mess of instructions that's hard to explain.<br />
                <br />
                It's a plate of spaghetti, a jumbled mess,<br />
                Where the noodles are code and the sauce is stress,<br />
                It's hard to follow, hard to debug,<br />
                And with every change, it grows like a shrub.<br />
                <br />
                It's a labyrinth of logic, a web of code,<br />
                Where every line is a tangled node,<br />
                It's hard to read, hard to maintain,<br />
                And fixing bugs feels like a losing game.<br />
                <br />
                It's a code that's twisted, a code that's flawed,<br />
                A code that's tough to work with, a code that's odd,<br />
                But fear not, dear coder, for there's a way,<br />
                To straighten out the mess, to make it okay.<br />
                <br />
                With patience and planning, and a bit of skill,<br />
                You can turn that spaghetti into a thrill,<br />
                You can make it neat, you can make it clean,<br />
                And make that code a coder's dream.<br />
                <br />
                So fear not the spaghetti, dear coder friend,<br />
                For with a bit of work, it can be on the mend,<br />
                And when you're done, you'll have a code that's sound,<br />
                And you'll be the master of that codebase ground.<br />
